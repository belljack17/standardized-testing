    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Although once thought to be useful for classifying student competence and preparing students for admission to college, in recent years, standardized testing has been scrutinized due to multiple problems preventing it from being an ideal metric for measuring students’ academic performance. Cheating scandals, test center closures during the pandemic, and, most pertinent to this project, inequity in test preparation resources based on socioeconomic factors, have all contributed to questions about the validity of standardized tests and their incorporation in college admissions decisions. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This project aims to investigate the impacts socioeconomic factors and standardized testing in college admission by analyzing institutional-level data about students’ race/ethnicity and economic status, as well as data about the institutions’ sizes, admissions practices, and aggregate secondary school performance to determine if these factors play a statistically significant role in test scores and admissions, and to what degree these factors are significant. The goal of this project is to uncover hidden biases in the admissions process and identify all factors that could contribute to an institution's admissions statistics, especially with testing. This is accomplished through a random forest regression with feature analysis, an investigation into the effect of Pell grant reception with a single component regression, and principal component analysis with k-means clustering. \n"

    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we chose to use was the Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data Set, a federally compiled database of all institutions that receive federal assistance, also known as IPEDS. Initially, the investigation was meant to use testing statistics for individual students, but the lack of data availability and consistency led us to shift our focus toward the IPEDS dataset. The data, being at the institutional level, means that each statistic is for the entire university, not any particular student. For the sake of this investigation, we are treating the data for an institution as if it is representative of the institution’s values and admissions practices. Any logic or conclusions gained from this investigation should not be used to evaluate individual students.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The initially pulled IPEDS dataset had 230 columns and over 6000 rows with data for the 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020 school years. Many institutions lacked sufficient data and many columns were not necessary, as they contained data that was not relevant to the investigation including graduate student and gender-based statistics. The data cleaning process consisted of dropping empty rows and columns with unnecessary data, splitting the single database into one for each academic year, changing the column names to be easily indexed, and calculating the acceptance rate by dividing the number of students admitted by the number of students applied for each institution. After this process, we were left with three data frames, one for each year, of nearly 900 rows and 45 columns. After running the regression models that will be presented in the next section using all three data frames, each model had relatively similar r2 values and variable coefficients. As a result, we chose to present the data from the most recent academic year as representative of all three.\n"

    "One of the assumptions required for this is that the college’s statistics accurately represent the population of that school. There is also a selection bias in the college admissions process since colleges have certain admission policies, which may inhibit ideal analysis of the college’s demographics. Additionally, factors like a college’s implementation of affirmative action may skew the selection of ethnic, socioeconomic, and standardized testing data. For the sake of this investigation, we are treating the data as if it is representative of institutions’ values and admissions practices. PELL Grants are a federal grant provided to students of low income by their institution, so we used the percentage of an institution’s students on PELL Grants as a proximity estimation for the percentage of students in poor economic standing.\n",

    "As we are interested in the factors that affect college admissions, we chose a random forest regressor as one of our methods to see how important each feature is in predicting test scores. We chose to use a regressor as the target variables we predicted were continuous values. You can read more about how a random forest model works [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2?gi=b522b39bebc8).\n",

    "Once we had solved for the feature importances, we found that one feature was far more significant in the random forest regressor than others, so we chose to further investigate that individual feature using a classic regression model between ACT 75th percentile score and the feature. This would allow us to directly observe any relationship between the two and whether the correlation was positive or negative.\n"
